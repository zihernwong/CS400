It was a dark and rainy day, and our hero was very bored. He was all alone and stuck in the house, making him start to go a little bit crazy. He started talking to his cat and dog, but they could understand a single word he was saying. He then started making a house of cards hoping that it would be fun, but he couldn't get it past the second level without it falling. He went to to do a puzzle that his Grandma had gotten him, but after a while, he realized a couple of pieces were missing. It seemed as though nothing was going his way.
Through all this, what kept him going was the fact that he was grateful to be alive. With a lot of people dying from the Coronavirus, he was just glad to be alive and have all of his family still alive. He really couldn't imagine living without them. He continued to just lay in bed to take a nap. This was when our hero was awoken by his sister telling him that the NBA finals was on and it was game one! Because our hero totally forgot, he was suddenly excited. However this excitement was killed when he realized a thunderstorm and taken out all the power. His sad day continued. This is where his day took a turn for the better.
